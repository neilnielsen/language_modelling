# Language Modelling Implementations

A bunch of random implementations of all sorts of things related to language modelling

## Getting Started

Most of the stuff implemented comes from [this book](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/). 

### Prerequisites

```python
pip install numpy
```

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### Installing



### Need to do

- Change Viterbi algorithm for HMM to have better complexity. Use Beam search
- Add end-of-sequence marker (use deleted-interpolation)

## Running the tests

Need to add nosetests
